# I received my Ph.D in Graduate School of Data Science at KAIST under the supervision of [Prof. Jae-Gil Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=h9mbv9MAAAAJ). Throughout my research, I have studied various kinds of topics to help AI deal with real-world problems. Specifically, I am interested in advancing AI to better serve people, such as in recommender systems or AI assistants that became more than essential in everyday life.
