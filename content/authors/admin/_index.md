I am a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in Graduate School of Knowledge Service Engineering at KAIST. I am studying in [Data Mining Lab](https://dm.kaist.ac.kr) with [Prof. Jae-Gil Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=h9mbv9MAAAAJ) as my advisor. Throughout my research, I have studied various kinds of topics to help AI deal with real-world problems. Specifically, I am interested in advancing AI to better serve people, such as in recommender systems or AI assistants that became more than essential in everyday life.

I also had a chance to work as an applied scientist intern in Amazon Alexa AI (Sep. 2021 ~ Dec. 2021) with my manager [Dr. Sungjin Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=ko&user=QRUsx4QAAAAJ), my mentors [Dr. Jinoh Oh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s7ZnGN8AAAAJ) and [Dr. Jae Do](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81436600021), and my collaborators [Dr. Tara Taghavi](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81100367424h) and [Dr. Amin Fazel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GClAPy0AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao).

I am open to work as full-time employment after my graduation (Spring 2022), feel free to contact me via email!
